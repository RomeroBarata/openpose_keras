### About this fork

 This repo was forked from the [Anatolix fork](https://github.com/anatolix/keras_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) of [Realtime Multi-Person Pose Estimation](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation).

For changes to original [Realtime Multi-Person Pose Estimation](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) repository, see the [Michal Faber fork](https://github.com/michalfaber/keras_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) and the [Anatolix fork](https://github.com/anatolix/keras_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation)

We have edited the Anatolix fork to do transfer learning, starting with the trained CMU model weights.

## Changes

- Add config file to main folder
- Add video demo
- Remove segmentation mask from training code
- Add instructions
